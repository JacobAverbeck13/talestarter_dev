		<h2>Main Goals</h2>

			<li class="col-lg-12">
				<p style="font-size:18px;">
					This website is designed to give new or casual writers a medium for conceiving,
					structuring, writing, editing, and publishing new stories.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="col-lg-12">
				<p style="font-size:18px;">
					The <b>Tasks</b> system will allow authors to ask for outside input with certain
					small portions of their story, such as object descriptions or the back-story of a minor character.
					This provides writers with the opportunity to build off the strengths of other writers while still giving them
					complete control over what is added into their story. 
					
				</p>
			</li>
			<li class="col-lg-12">
				<p style="font-size:18px;">
					Many people enjoy reading new and upcoming stories, so <b>TaleStarter</b> gives visitors
					the opportunity to read and rate newly released stories written by people like you!

					are incorporated into their story.
